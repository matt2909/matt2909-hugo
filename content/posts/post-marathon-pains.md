So, yesterday I ran the London Marathon for the 3rd time. My preparation was far from ideal this year, I got injured in the month before (strained hip muscle) and so unfortunately I never got enough mileage into my training regime. This meant that at about 13 miles the run became more about will power than physical power. My mind started to tell me to give up, and my aching body was sending strong signals to my brain that that would be the best thing to do. Fortunately I had a really strong #reasontorun this year, as I was running for Mencap, a fabulous charity that does so much to support and provide opportunities to those with learning disabilities.

My sponsorship page is still open, for those wishing to sponsor me post-surviving, it's at [RunningAgainForAda](http://virginmoneygiving.com/runningagainforada).
